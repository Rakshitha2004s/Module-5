# Exp.No:22 Destructor
# AIM
To create a Python class Student with a destructor.

# ALGORITHM
Begin the program. Define the student class. Inside the student class, define the init method (constructor) and the del method (destructor). Create an object s2 of the student class. When the object s2 is created, the init method is called, and its print statements are executed. Use the del statement to delete the object s2. This triggers the del method (destructor), and the respective print statements are executed. Terminate the program.
